In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@centurylocal is owned by @centuryholdingsgroup founded in 2016 by @jeffcentury all rights reserved\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nNeed Help?
